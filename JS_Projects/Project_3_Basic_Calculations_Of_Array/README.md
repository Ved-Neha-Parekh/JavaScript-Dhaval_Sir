A collection of beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript programs showcasing core programming concepts through practical examples of array manipulation.

---

## ‚ú® Features

* üéØ **Diverse Examples**: Explore various and essential array methods (`push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `splice`, `slice`, `sort`, `map`, `forEach`, `filter`, `find`, `some`, `every`).
* üìä **Array Manipulation**: Learn to create, access, modify, and transform arrays using built-in JavaScript methods, and perform checks on array elements.
* üñ•Ô∏è **Console-Based**: All programs are designed to run directly in the console, providing a straightforward execution environment.
* üå± **Beginner-Friendly**: Code is written with clarity and simplicity, ideal for those learning JavaScript fundamentals.
* üß© **Modular & Standalone**: Each program is an independent file, promoting easy isolation and testing of individual concepts.

## üìÇ Programs Overview

This project includes the following JavaScript programs:

* `main.js`: A mini Employee Management System demonstrating various array methods like `push`, `pop`, `unshift`, `shift`, `splice`, `map`, `filter`, `forEach`, `indexOf`, and `includes`.
* `prog_1_create_access_and_modify.js`: Basic array operations: creating an empty array and adding numbers with `push()`, accessing elements, modifying elements by index, and creating mixed-data arrays.
* `prog_2_basic_methods.js`: Demonstrates fundamental array methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `shift()`, and `unshift()` for adding and removing elements from both ends of an array.
* `prog_3_splice.js`: Examples of the `splice()` method for deleting elements from an array by index, adding elements without deletion, and replacing elements.
* `prog_4_slice.js`: Demonstrates the `slice()` method for extracting portions of an array, creating a full copy, and using negative indices.
* `prog_5_sort.js`: Shows how to sort arrays using `sort()` (with and without a compare function) and how to reverse a sorted array.
* `prog_6_map.js`: Examples of the `map()` method for transforming array elements (e.g., squaring numbers, converting to uppercase, adding a constant, converting to string).
* `prog_7_forEach.js`: Practical uses of `forEach()` for iterating over array elements, printing values with their indices, doubling numbers, greeting names, squaring numbers, and calculating a sum.
* `prog_8_filter.js`: Demonstrates the `filter()` method to extract specific elements from an array (e.g., even numbers, numbers greater than a value, negative numbers, words of a specific length).
* `prog_9_find.js`: Examples of the `find()` method to locate the first element that satisfies a given condition (e.g., first number greater than a value, first fruit starting with 'B').
* `prog_10_some.js`: Demonstrates the `some()` method to check if at least one element in an array passes a given test condition.
* `prog_11_every.js`: Demonstrates the `every()` method to check if all elements in an array pass a given test condition.
