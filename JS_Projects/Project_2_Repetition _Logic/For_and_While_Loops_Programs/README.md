# üîÑ JavaScript Loop Programs (for, while and do...while loops)

This repository features a collection of 27 mini JavaScript programs, each demonstrating the use of `for while and do...while` loops to solve various numerical problems, including calculating sums, identifying prime numbers, and manipulating digits. These console-based scripts are designed to provide clear examples of iterative control flow.

## üî• Features

* **Diverse Examples**: A rich set of programs covering various scenarios, from basic number checks and printing patterns to complex sum calculations and series generation.
* **Fundamental Concepts**: Clear demonstrations of `if/else`, `switch` statements, and various looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do...while`).
* **Console-Based**: All programs are designed to run in the console, making them easy to execute and understand without complex setups.
* **Beginner-Friendly**: Code is written with clarity and simplicity, ideal for those learning JavaScript fundamentals.
* **Modular Design**: Each program is a standalone file, allowing for easy isolation and testing of individual concepts.
