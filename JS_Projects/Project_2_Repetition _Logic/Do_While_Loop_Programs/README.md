# üîÑ JavaScript Loop Programs (do...while)

This repository showcases a collection of 20 fundamental JavaScript programs, each designed to illustrate various applications of the `do...while` loop. These console-based scripts tackle common numerical and logical problems, providing practical examples of iterative control flow in JavaScript.

## üìÅ Programs Overview

Explore the following JavaScript programs, all built using `do...while` loops:

* **`prog_1.js`**: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
* **`prog_2.js`**: Computes the sum of even numbers within the range of 1 to 20.
* **`prog_3.js`**: Determines the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 20.
* **`prog_4.js`**: Finds the sum of multiples of 5 between 1 and 50.
* **`prog_5.js`**: Calculates the sum of squares for numbers from 1 to 10.
* **`prog_6.js`**: Sums the individual digits of a given number (e.g., 12345).
* **`prog_7.js`**: Calculates the sum of numbers divisible by both 3 and 7 within 1 to 100.
* **`prog_8.js`**: Computes the sum of prime numbers up to 50, demonstrating nested loops.
* **`prog_9.js`**: Calculates the sum of the first 10 natural numbers.
* **`prog_10.js`**: Determines the sum of even numbers between 50 and 100 (inclusive).
* **`prog_11.js`**: Calculates the sum of odd numbers between 100 and 150 (inclusive).
* **`prog_12.js`**: Calculates the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 50.
* **`prog_13.js`**: Calculates the sum of numbers not divisible by 3 within the range of 1 to 30.
* **`prog_14.js`**: Computes the sum of factorials from 1! to 5! ($1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5!$).
* **`prog_15.js`**: Calculates the sum of all numbers ending with the digit 7 between 1 and 100.
* **`prog_16.js`**: Calculates the sum of numbers from 1 up to 'n' until the sum exceeds 50.
* **`prog_17.js`**: Calculates the sum of numbers between 10 and 30 that are not divisible by 2 or 3.
* **`prog_18.js`**: Computes the sum of cubes for numbers from 1 to 5.
* **`prog_19.js`**: Calculates the sum of numbers divisible by 4 but not by 8 within the range of 1 to 50.
* **`prog_20.js`**: Calculates the sum of alternate numbers (1, 3, 5... up to 19).

Each program is self-contained and written entirely in **pure JavaScript**.
