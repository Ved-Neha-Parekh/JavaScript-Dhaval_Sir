## üìÅ Programs Overview

This project includes the following JavaScript programs, each demonstrating different aspects of function usage:

* **`add_two.js`**: A simple function to add two numbers, showcasing both traditional and arrow function syntax.
* **`area_of_rectangle.js`**: Calculates the area of a rectangle, demonstrating parameter passing and return values with both function types.
* **`count_vowels.js`**: Counts the number of vowels in a given string, illustrating string iteration and conditional logic within a function.
* **`discount.js`**: Determines discount eligibility based on total bill amount and membership status, a practical application of conditional functions.
* **`factorial.js`**: Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer, demonstrating iterative computation within a function.
* **`fibonacci.js`**: Generates a Fibonacci series up to a specified number of terms, showcasing sequence generation.
* **`grade_calculator.js`**: Assigns a letter grade based on a numerical score, an example of conditional logic for classification.
* **`greet_function.js`**: A basic function to greet a user by name, illustrating simple parameter usage and string interpolation.
* **`info_about_function_in_JS.js`**: **(Highly Recommended!)** A comprehensive script explaining various types of JavaScript functions (Declarations, Expressions, Arrow, Anonymous, IIFE) and their characteristics, including parameter and return value patterns (TNRN, TNRS, TSRN, TSRS).
* **`is_even.js`**: Checks if a given number is even or odd, providing a straightforward boolean return example.
* **`is_prime.js`**: Determines if a given number is a prime number, demonstrating a common mathematical function.
* **`max_of_three_nums.js`**: Finds the maximum value among three given numbers, showcasing comparison logic.
* **`palindrome.js`**: Checks if a string is a palindrome, illustrating string manipulation and reversal logic.
* **`personal_info.js`**: Displays personal information (name, age, city), demonstrating how functions can encapsulate and present data.
* **`print_nums.js`**: Prints a range of numbers from a specified start to end, showing basic looping for output.
* **`reverse_str.js`**: Reverses a given string, providing another example of string manipulation.
* **`simple_interest.js`**: Calculates simple interest on a principal amount, rate, and time, a practical financial calculation.
* **`sum_of_even.js`**: Calculates the sum of even numbers within a specified range, demonstrating iterative summation.

Each program is standalone and written in **pure JavaScript**.
