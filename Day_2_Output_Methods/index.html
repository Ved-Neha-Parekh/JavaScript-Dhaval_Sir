    <h1>JavaScript Output Methods - Simple Demo</h1>

    <!-- This paragraph will be updated by JavaScript using innerHTML -->
    <p id="dynamicParagraph">This paragraph will be updated by JavaScript.</p>

    <!-- This div will also be updated by JavaScript using innerHTML -->
    <div id="outputDiv">This is where JavaScript output will appear...</div>

    <script>
      // --- 1. console.log() Method ---
      // console.log() is used for debugging. Messages appear in the browser's Developer Console (press F12).
      // Users will NOT see this directly on the webpage.
      console.log("--- Console Log Demo ---");
      console.log("This message is visible in the browser's console.");
      let consoleMessage = "Hello from the console!";
      console.log("Variable content:", consoleMessage);
      console.log("A number:", 123);
      console.log("A boolean:", true);

      // --- 2. alert() Method ---
      // alert() creates a pop-up dialog box with a message and an "OK" button.
      // It blocks the webpage interaction until the user clicks "OK".
      // This alert will appear as soon as the page loads.
      let alertText = "This is a simple alert message!";
      alert(alertText);
      console.log("Alert displayed: " + alertText); // Log to console after alert is dismissed

      // --- 3. document.getElementById().innerHTML Method ---
      // innerHTML is used to change the content (text or HTML) inside an HTML element.
      // This is the most common way to display dynamic content directly on the webpage.

      // Get the paragraph element by its ID and update its content
      let paragraphContent =
        "This text was inserted into the paragraph using innerHTML.";
      document.getElementById("dynamicParagraph").innerHTML = paragraphContent;
      console.log("Paragraph updated using innerHTML.");

      // Get the div element by its ID and update its content
      let divContent =
        "And this text was inserted into the div using innerHTML.";
      document.getElementById("outputDiv").innerHTML = divContent;
      console.log("Div updated using innerHTML.");

      // --- 4. document.write() Method ---
      // CAUTION: document.write() is generally NOT used in modern web development.
      // If called AFTER the page has fully loaded, it will OVERWRITE the entire existing HTML content.
      // In this simple example, it will run immediately after the script loads, overwriting everything above it.
      console.log("document.write() will now overwrite the entire page.");
      document.write("<h2>This content came from document.write()!</h2>");
      document.write("<p>The previous HTML content has been replaced.</p>");
      document.write(
        "<button onclick='location.reload()'>Reload Page</button>"
      ); // Button to reload the page
    </script>
  </body>
